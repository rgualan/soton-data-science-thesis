# Air Quality - The Next Generation Air Pollution Monitoring Systems (aq-tngapms)

This project implements the experiments of the dissertation entitled "Spatio temporal modeling of air pollution concentrations". A dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the degree of MSc. Data Science in the University of Southampton. 

The directory structure is as follows:

* exploration: contains EDA scripts 
* img: contains the plots to be included in the report
* logs: logs of the executions (mainly from the simulations and long models ran in the Lyceum cluster)
* model: gather all the assessed models grouped by category
* pbs_scripts: PBS scripts to run parallel scripts in the Lyceum cluster
* preprocessing: contains preprocessing scripts
* scraping: scripts created to collect data from several sources
* synthetic: experiments to create synthetic point-referenced air pollution data (incomplete)
* util: helper script gathering common functions used along the experiments
